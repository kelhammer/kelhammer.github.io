<br>

<h2>What your process was like?</h2>

<br>

First, we did preliminary research. Some of that research was together in class, but a lot of it was individual. We then met again 
to compare what we had found and find our final direction. After choosing our final direction, we both wrote sections from the script (some
different and some overlapping). I also wrote a preliminary audio script. We then came together again and combined all three pieces into a 
final speaker note / recording version. We then recorded each section (sometimes with multiple takes!) and compiled those recordings into the powerpoint.

<br>

In class we worked on the template together. Ellen did most of the tinkering via keyboard and I helped her by giving notes, discussing possibilities, and trouble shooting when
issues arose in our first draft of the powerpoint. For the second and third draft we worked togething in a 
conference room with a whiteboard and a table. It was very official! 
We filled in content and then began to tinker with fun stuff. I figured out how to do fragments and dictated the code to 
Ellen and worked on the color coding myself.

<br>

Ellen and I also collaboratively talked a lot about the subject matter, our design principles, and presentation principles. 
I felt like we worked really well together and both
contributed a lot of work, excitement, and quality to the project. 
 
<br>

<h2>Any lightbulbs that came on for you:</h2>

<br>

I think one lightbulb I had was that we were basically creating from scratch what Prezi does which is cool. Ellen and 
I also had a lot of fun learning about design and data visualization
from Edward Tufte. Just studying his work and thought processes was a lightbulb moment itself. 

<br>

<h2>Any challenges you overcame:</h2>

<br>

I think we actually had a really good time making this project. It's not that it was easy, but rather we brainstormed and outlined our idea, then we used the template to implement our idea
and tweaked when necessary. We researched and scripted well and because we've been working together all semester on projects it was easier to integrate our ideas, plans, and work into
a cohesive unit. We ran into troubleshooting problems, but at this point in the class we are used to that! And were able to fix things eventually. 

<br>

<h2>How this project used various skills and attitudes you've developed over the course 
of this class</h2>

<br>

I kind of answered that above, but in a way this project used everything: trouble shooting, collaboration, design, structure, conversion, navigation, push/pull, command line, etc. 
I think we didn't freak out as much as usual when we found problems and we used our best skills to come together as a team. We looked at how something can work well but also look
nice `swank` and tried to build something good and then flashy, rather than flashy with no support. 

<br>

<h2>How you might use these skills and attitudes in your future studies or career </h2>

<br>

I think this class will definitely help me in the future because I not only gained an understanding of how computers work
(and how people work with them), but also how to work collaboratively
on complex projects, troubleshoot, and speak a new language `git`. 

<br>

I am definitely going to use the pandoc document and presentation skills I learned in this class in my future graduate career.

<br>

Overall, I hope you enjoyed our project. We had fun making it and I really loved being in this class. Thanks for making coding fun! 

<br> 

Till next time!

<br>
