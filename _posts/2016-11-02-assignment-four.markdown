<h1> Assignment 4 Reflections </h1>


<br> 
This assignment was an interesting one and I felt like I learned a lot more working with my team than 
in the previous assignment where I was working by myself. In fact, I feel like I learned 
some of the things that I didn't have time to dive into last week like how to add color and
make scripts more complex.


<br> 

Uri and Tabs were amazing on this project. I learned so much from them and they were 
really engaged and encouraging. I wish I could have contributed more to the group 
but Tab was typing and Uri was our 
info man. I stayed involved, but this was way more a learning experience for me than a sharing. 
It was great to coloborate. Some of the walls that we hit and overcame included creating strings, 
consolidating all of our files (both to set up project and for the data creation), and getting colorss
to work for the script. I actually trouble shooted this! That's why we were cheering in class (haha). 
I realized that we had left out a flag. Overall I thought we did pretty well trouble shooting by 
googling info and talking things out. 

<br> 

Our group worked really well together. In the first and second class,
I helped guide the group through the requirements and to-do-lists of 
the assignment, Tabitha did the typing, and Uri did external searching
for tips and tricks. In the second class, Tabitha set up the script, 
Uri helped connect all the pieces, and I helped with trouble shooting. 
While I was involved and engaged with the second class, I didn't feel
as helpful. Tabitha and Uri were very much on top of the assignment
and while I learned a lot, I didn't provide as much work as I wanted to.
Part of that was hard because we had one person type which was very
helpful for completing the project as a group, but not necessarily 
when you go write your reflection! 

<br> 

Tabitha and I were also slightly worn out in the second class because
we went to the Obama rally. We waited for four hours and never saw
Obama! It's okay though because I saw him here in 2012 and I got to 
sing along with James Taylor. I am actually really glad we left to
come back to class because we got to be in the A.C. and our group 
worked so well together that we finished the project on time and don't have to work
on it this weekend. We took
some pictures to show our journey. The first one has two titles 
"It's Hot" and "Hauser You Were Right, Let's Go to Class" and the
second one is called "Two Birds With One Stone" 

<br>
Till next time!
