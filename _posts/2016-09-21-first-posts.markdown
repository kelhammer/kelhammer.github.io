This is my first post for INLS 161. I know most of our posts will be about coding and class activites, so I thought I would write about something different. 
This might be my only chance to do so and because the actual behind the scenes coding can be stressful, it might help to write about something engaging so 
creating content doesn't stand in the way of presenting content, which for a beginner coder can be difficult. 

So what are we going to talk about?
