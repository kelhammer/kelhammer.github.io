This is my first post for `INLS 161`. So far in this class I have a learned a lot about Github and working on the command line. I have struggled a lot so far in understanding
how the systems as large entities work, but I'm starting to get a grasp on the language and basic funtions of our coding assignments. So far the commands that I understand 
best are **cd**, **pwd**, **git init**, **ls**, **git add**, and **git commit**. I can now run **jekyll** and add changes, commit changes, and push those changes to my website. I am just starting to learn
the css rules, but I've used css briefly before. I'm hoping that some of that knowledge comes back. Overall, I am very exctied with what I've learned so far in this class. I am 
starting to remember the basic processes and don't have to check my notes quite as much. My website is starting to look good and I can't wait to improve it more.
