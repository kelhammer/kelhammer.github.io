This is my first post for INLS 161. I know most of our posts will be about coding and class activites, so I thought I would write about something different. 
This might be my only chance to do so and because the actual behind the scenes coding can be stressful, it might help to write about something engaging so 
creating content doesn't stand in the way of presenting content, which for a beginner coder can be difficult. 

So what are we going to talk about? 

Let's talk about the upcoming series of Doctor Who. The next series of Doctor Who is rumored to be released in April. This means no fall season but a 
Christmas special has been announced. While this time frame differs from recent history for the series, it will allow star Peter Capaldi more time to rest from the previous series'
filming blocks. Series 9's filming blocks were notoriously long and ardous for Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman. A spread out filming schedule also allows for increased
quality in post production and reshoots. 

We will also have a new companion when Doctor Who returns. Jenna Coleman, the longest running companion actor in Doctor Who's fifty year history, departed the show after her
third series to star in ITV's Victoria. Her character on the program, Clara Oswald, was written off the series in the season finale. BBC announced earlier this year that Clara 
Oswald would be replaced as a companion by a new character named Bill, played by Pearl Mackie. Mackie's new character could be named after Billie Piper who played Rose Tyler. 
Rose Tyler was the first companion in the New Who era of Doctor Who starting in 2005. The first episode of the New Who era was titled Rose after her character and Rose is
consistently voted as the best companion in Doctor Who history.
