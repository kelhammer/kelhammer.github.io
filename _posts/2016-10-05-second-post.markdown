Assignment 2 was an interesting assignment for me with its various ups and downs. To start off, I know I've learned a whole lot during this assignment and definitely have a better grasp on command line functions then I did back in
Assignment 1. I really like my color scheme and layout and I have enjoyed embedding tweets and adding icons into the site. This assignment as been stressful though. I seemed to have trouble at each turn when I started exploring 
within my theme. Understanding how the theme was constructed and supported is still something I am wrapping my mind around. I also am still trying to think of ways to "swankify" my site. I have a minimalistic style in most of my
design activities, but for this assignment I was asked to add something a little extra. I tried to do that with content rather than layout, since I really like how most of it was set up. Overall, I'm worried because it took me a while
to fix errors and learn github and that time spent in retroactive learning and problem solving took time away from my creative process. Overall though, I really like my website and I am excited to see what else I can learn and how I can
improve my site going forward.
