<h1> Assignment 5 Reflections </h1>

<p> Greetings Hauser! Hope you are doing well.</p>

<br>

<h2> Scripts: </h2>

<p>Currently my Cloud 9 workspace for Assignment 5 will not open so I'm going
to write what I can remember without the script in front of me. If you're 
reading this, then my C9 workspace would not open by the deadline and I 
apologize for not going into further detail. <p>

<br>

<p> Our script has variables for MySQL username and password. It asks questions in different colors and collects the answers. 
The script also uses SQL INSERT statements instead of loading a CSV file. I know it does a lot, but C9 is still being funky and I can't remember anymore than what I listed above. I will check back again. 

<br> 

<h2> Reflection: </h2>

<br> 

Since last time we worked in a group I didn't keep track of what 
I did I wrote it all down this go around. This was pretty simple 
because one of my jobs this time was note-taker for the group. I
kept track of our questions in class so we would be ready when we 
met with you and I kept notes about what where we left off each class
period so when we came back next time we could jump right in. The 
group found this helpful! Below is the list of some of the things I did 
this time around above my basic group member duties of participation
and push/pulling:

<br>

 <ul> Human sign  </ul>
 <ul> Moral support  </ul>
 <ul> Helped with cloning and removing .git folder  </ul>
 <ul> Read out directions for database creation  </ul>
 <ul> Kept task notes for group  </ul>
 <ul> Problem solved date integer  </ul>
 <ul> In charge of connecting group through emails  </ul>

<br> 

<p> Overall this time I felt more involved. I was really glad we got to keep
the same group because our group really likes each other and we work
well together. We mesh our distinct skills together well and we have
a great working relationship. This project was really hard because
so much of it had to be figured out on our own and I'm glad I had this
group to struggle with because we struggle together well! 

<br> 

In this project I learned about mysql. It was interesting how unfriendly
the system was compared to systems (like github) that are so user friendly. 
I think my favorite lesson from this part of the course was learning about 
databases from the whiteboard. I have never thought about databases in that
logical and spatial way and I think it helped later when we were building 
the database. This project really made me think spatially and logically. Really
thinking about what goes where and how. I know all of computer science is like
that but this project made me feel that more than ever. 

<br>

We found a lot of challenges along the way. Mostly we would build and run a script
and it would partially work, but then we would have to figure out why it wasn't working
exactly how we wanted or producing what we wanted. We also had a hard time combining all
our data the end but we worked it out! We were so excited that we made this to show you 
and celebrate that we had conquered our mysql challenges. Hope you enjoy!
