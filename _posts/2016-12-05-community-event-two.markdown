<h1> Assignment 6 Reflections </h1>

<p> Greetings Hauser!</p>

<h2> Community Event Write Up #2 </h2>

So for my second community event I went to a workshop called "Turning Data into Infographics: An Interactive Workshop for Problem Solvers." The event was put on
by two campus groups: SkillfUL (a workshop series from the Undergraduate Library's Design Lab) and CUBE (a program for social entrepeneurs through the Campus Y and UNCâ€™s Center for 
Social Justice and Social Innovation). 

<br>

The workshop included information about how to find statistical data and then create effective infographs usign design and data software. The software we used for this class was 
Adobe Illustrator which is a new software for me. I also don't have a strong background in statistical data so I thought this would be a perfect class to learn both sides of data
visualization and infographics. We also looked at some other tools that can help with infographics including Piktochart, CartoDB, and Tableau. 

<br>

My favorite part of the class was looking at really bad infographics that people had manipulated using the software (or by accident) that convey grossly incorrect information. It's 
scary how you will believe anything that looks nice or ignore good information that looks bad. It was really a good class to get me thinking about design principles for
the types of items we have been talking about in class like web pages, documents, and presentations. Design (aka CSS and formatting) really do matter. 

<br>

I think the basic principle of looking at how data is turned into objects is really important in the context of this class because that's basically everything we do. We take the basic units
of information and turn them into something bigger, greater, and more concrete. If you don't plan though, or take stock in the appearance of what you're doing, you might lose some of your
power. It's important to build good systems, insightful documents, and fun websites, but it's also important to make sure those items are both accurate and aesthetically pleasing. 

<br>

We built a poster in the class using InDesign that addressed food poverty in the U.S.. I found Adobe Illustrator to be quite frustrating compared to Adobe InDesign. It does have a lot of 
power though and it's cool to be able to manipulate images and graphs. 

<br>

It was also nice to meet up with a community I've never met up with on campus before. I went here for undergrad, but I had never met up with CUBE. The whole class was mostly CUBE people
who were looking for ways to convey data from their entrepreneurial projects. They had a lot of passion for the project, but a lot of them had little experience. I had a little 
experience but no big project to work on. I liked the class because we heard from two different groups and there was time for discussion so I really got to talk to other people from the 
group. We also had food before the event which was yummy, but also a great time to network. 

<br>

Overall, it was really fun to meet with members of a cool community here on campus and learn new software and design principles. I learned new technology skills that I didn't have before,
but will definitely use in the future. 

<br>

I also attended a data visualizatio workshop on Friday that was mostly about Tableau. Tableau is a really cool tool and not quite as complicated as I thought it would be. That's a good
reminder that you shouldn't always be intimidated by new software because sometimes it's just what you need and not as bad as you imagined! 

<br>

I also wanted to give you an update on my 3D printing adventures since my first community workshop event. I've printed two items so far and a third is on the way. I am really glad that 
I went to the introduction workshop for this assignment in the course becuase I made some friends over there and my bosses were really impressed with the work I did. I made a little
UL for our library social media campaigns and it turned out great `well` it's been a learning curve. The design itself is fine but having to work with the scaffolding and support systems
has caused issues with the final product which involved paint, plyers, and reprints. It's great though, because I love having to think how something I design on the computer is going 
to print out and how the printer hardware will be able to handle the design. It's also very hands on which I like. It's been a lot of fun working with the Kenan Makerspace to develop
my project and it's actually one of my favorite things about my first semester at SILS. 

<br>

Overall, I've really enjoyed both of my experiences because they taught me really valuable skills and introduced me to new communities
and contacts in the UNC community.
