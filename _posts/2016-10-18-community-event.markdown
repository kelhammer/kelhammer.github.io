<p> For my community event, I attended a 3D Printing Introduction Workshop at Kenan Science Library’s <a href="http://library.unc.edu/makerspace/">Makerspace</a>. 
I wanted to attend this event because I am interested in 3D printing and had an idea in mind for an object I wanted to print for my job.
It was an introduction workshop so we didn’t go too deep into design and creation, but it was nice to learn about the basics and tools that
a person needs to print an object. In the workshop, I learned about the types of printers, plastic, file formats, and design tools I will need
to create the object I have in mind. Some interesting things I learned were: it is possible to 3D print something in gold, the plastics 
commonly used for printing 3D objects expand during printing process so if you have fitted pieces you have to accommodate for expansion in your 
design, objects must be water tight, the bonds between the filament are weaker than the filament itself, printing at UNC is free 
(at only 300 grams per month), and you can have 3D printed materials in most primary colors. I also was shown and experimented with the 3D printing
software <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a> .

Overall it was a really great learning experience and I am excited about what it possible with 3D printing. 
There were a couple other people in the workshop with all kinds of projects and it was fun to talk about 
problem solving, technology capabilities/limits, and design ideas with other students and staff in the community.
I plan on going back to more workshops for 3D printing (and maybe more) at the Kenan Library Science Makerspace. 
It was also cool to see how computer coding can go beyond the digital and become something 3D and real. 
Also I'm big into making gifs and I made one to show off my first design! 
Till next time!
