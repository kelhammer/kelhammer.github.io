<h1> Written Work </h1>
<br>
The written work that I included with this assignment is a brief summary about me that
I wrote for a class earlier this semester. It includes my background, current course of study, 
and passions.

<h1>Document Conversion </h1>
<br>
There were two ways to get my work into multiple formats that I used throughout the process. 
The first way was by running a pandoc argument on the command line eg. pandoc -S -o kelhammer.odt kelhammer.md. 
The other way to covert documents was to run them through my script that used similar arguments.
