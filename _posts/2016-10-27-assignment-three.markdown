<h1> Written Work </h1>
<br>
The written work that I included with this assignment is a brief summary about me that
I wrote for a class earlier this semester. It includes my background, current course of study, 
and passions.
<br>

<h1>Document Conversion </h1>

<br>
There were two ways to get my work into multiple formats that I used throughout the process. 
The first way was by running a `pandoc` argument on the command line eg. `pandoc -S -o kelhammer.odt kelhammer.md`. 
The other way to covert documents was to run them through my script that used similar flags and argument structure. 
I had the system walk the user through converting their file into each file type.

<h1> Reflections </h1>

Greetings Hauser! Is it cool if I call you Hauser? Well I'm commiting to that nickname. That was a poor attempt at 
a coding joke (git commit nickname). Everyone knows the best jokes are the ones you have to explain `sarcasm` Yikes. It's been a busy week and the amount of time I've slept would not be 
recommended by health professionals. That being said, I think I actually accomplished this assignment. That's going to be a 
a really embarrassing sentence if it turns out I pulled a total fail, but I really do feel I had a lightbulb moment during this assignment! 

<br> 

In class when we learning the `pandoc` stuff I felt like I really understood that, but when we got to scripts I knew we were in trouble, and 
by we I mean me (the lost one) and Ellen (the one to save the day). Bless Ellen who really helped me on this assignment.
I have history with script writing in another course and it did not go well. I can't even tell you what language we were writing in because I've literally 
blocked it from my mind. In <b>ILNS 161</b> when we talked about scripts, I could just tell it was not sinking into my brain (again), but I thought maybe by 
playing around I could learn it. That did not go so well. Ellen was able to show me what she was working with and explain some of the logic that got her
started. Once I started at the same place, I started building and things started to work! `collaboration` We ended up creating very differnt scripts but sharing some of the 
base logic really helped me get started. Thanks Ellen! Later I was able to help her with images too so the favor was returned! 

<br> 

I feel overall that I'm getting better at problem solving, whether its looking online or just testing things out. I had trouble getting my table to work
but I learned a lot of things and gained some new resources while I was problem solving. I also had a couple of ticks to work out getting everything into this 
blog post but I worked it out with some time and exploring. My only wish for this assignmentwas that it had fallen on a 
different week so I could have built more into my script. I would have loved to work with some `if` statements and make my script more interactive
with the user, but that just wasn't in the cards this week. Part of that is time constraints and part of it is bravery with coding.
